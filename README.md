# Query with dict

In your comment, you ask:

>Is there any way to get "ExtraProperties" column as Json in my query ? and then try to filter it ??

Given that `ExtraProperties` is a JSON string, you could make extension that does this by converting the string to a `Dictionary<string, object>` inline and using `Convert` on the value in the dictionary:

```
static partial class Extensions
{
    public static Dictionary<string, object> ToDict(this string json) =>
        JsonConvert
        .DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string, object>>(json ?? string.Empty)
        ?? new Dictionary<string, object>();
}
```

You could use it like this:

_I hope I have the EF syntax right. I do this all the time, but I'm working with the Google Drive API._

```
   var query = 
   (await repository.GetQueryableAsync())
    .Where(i => 
        Convert
        .ToBoolean(EF.Property<string>(i, "ExtraProperties").ToDict()["AutoGenerated"]));
```
